	abstract = {Unbiased characterization of whole-brain cytoarchitecture represents an invaluable tool for understanding brain function. For this, precise mapping of histological markers from 2D sections onto 3D brain atlases is pivotal. Here, we present two novel software tools facilitating this process: Aligning Big Brains and Atlases (ABBA), designed to streamline the precise and efficient registration of 2D sections to 3D reference atlases, and BraiAn, an integrated suite for multi-marker automated segmentation, whole-brain statistical analysis, and data visualisation. Combining these tools, we performed a comprehensive comparative study of the whole-brain expression of three of the most widely used immediate early genes (IEGs). Thanks to their neural activity-dependent expression, IEGs have been used for decades as a proxy of neural activity to generate unbiased mapping of activity following behaviour, but their respective induction in response to neuronal activation across the entire brain remains unclear. To address this question, we systematically compared the brain-wide expression cFos, Arc and NPAS4, three abundantly used IEGs, across three different behavioural conditions related to memory. Our results highlight major differences in both their distribution and induction patterns, indicating that they do not represent equivalent markers across brain areas or activity states, but can provide instead complementary information.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

More specifically, the number of subjects for which the registration outright failed was greatly reduced (from 40\% to 15\%) by using a synthesized image.},

Successful integration of these data requires a standard 3D reference atlas. Here, we present the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) as such a resource. We constructed an average template brain at 10 mm voxel resolution by interpolating high resolution in-plane serial two-photon tomography images with 100 mm z-sampling from 1,675 young adult C57BL/6J mice. Then, using multimodal reference data, we parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. CCFv3 can be used to analyze, visualize, and integrate multimodal and multiscale datasets in 3D and is openly accessible (https://atlas.brain-map.org/).},

This brain atlas features annotations of 222 structures, of which 112 are new and 57 revised compared to previous versions.

We clustered our dataset in ‘‘morphotypes,’’ establishing a unique database of quantitatively described neuronal morphologies together with their spatial coordinates in vivo. Over 100 transgene expression patterns were imaged separately and co-registered with the single-neuron atlas. By annotating 72 non-overlapping brain regions, we generated from our dataset an inter-areal wiring diagram of the larval brain, which serves as ground truth for synapse-scale, electron microscopic reconstructions. Interrogating our atlas by ‘‘virtual tract tracing’’ has already revealed previously unknown wiring principles in the tectum and the cerebellum.

Importantly, the brain and spinal cord of adult urodels (salamanders) have an incredible regeneration capacity, contrary to anurans (frogs) and the rest of adult vertebrates. Among these amphibians, the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) has gained most attention because of the surge in the understanding of central nervous system (CNS) regeneration and the recent sequencing of its whole genome. However, a complete comprehension of the brain anatomy is not available. In the present study we created a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atlas of the in vivo neuroanatomy of the juvenile axolotl brain. This is the first MRI atlas for this species and includes three levels: (1) 82 regions of interest (ROIs) and a version with 64 ROIs; (2) a division of the brain according to the embryological origin of the neural tube, and (3) left and right hemispheres. Additionally, we localized the myelin rich regions of the juvenile brain. The atlas, the template that the atlas was derived from, and a masking file, can be found on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4595016. This MRI brain atlas aims to be an important tool for future research of the axolotl brain and that of other amphibians.}

  abstract = {Automatic detection and segmentation of cells and nuclei in microscopy images is important for many biological applications. Recent successful learning-based approaches include per-pixel cell segmentation with subsequent pixel grouping, or localization of bounding boxes with subsequent shape refinement. In situations of crowded cells, these can be prone to segmentation errors, such as falsely merging bordering cells or suppressing valid cell instances due to the poor approximation with bounding boxes. To overcome these issues, we propose to localize cell nuclei via star-convex polygons, which are a much better shape representation as compared to bounding boxes and thus do not need shape refinement. To that end, we train a convolutional neural network that predicts for every pixel a polygon for the cell instance at that position. We demonstrate the merits of our approach on two synthetic datasets and one challenging dataset of diverse fluorescence microscopy images.},
