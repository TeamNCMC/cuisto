# Installation
This page will guide you to install all pieces of software required to map and quantify objects of interests in 2D images.

!!! tip
    If all goes well, you shouldn't need any admin rights to install the various pieces of software used before `cuisto`.

!!! danger "Important"
    Remember to cite *all* softwares you use ! See [Citing](main-citing.md).

## QuPath
QuPath is an "open source software for bioimage analysis". You can install it from the official website : [https://qupath.github.io/](https://qupath.github.io/).  
The documentation is quite clear and comprehensive : [https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

This is where you'll create QuPath projects, in which you'll be able to browse your images, annotate them, import registered brain regions and find objects of interests (via automatic segmentation, thresholding, pixel classification, ...). Then, those annotations and detections can be exported to be processed by `cuisto`.

## Aligning Big Brain and Atlases (ABBA)
This is the tool you'll use to register 2D histological sections to 3D atlases. See the dedicated page in the [next section](guide-install-abba.md).

## Python virtual environment manager (`conda`)

!!! tip "TL;DR"

    1. Install [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/), as user and adding to PATH.
    2. Open a terminal (PowerShell in Windows) and run `conda init`

The `cuisto` package is written in Python. It depends on scientific libraries (such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and many more). Those libraries need to be installed in versions that are compatible with `cuisto` and with each other. To make sure those versions do not conflict with other Python tools you might be using (`deeplabcut`, `abba_python`, ...), we will install `cuisto` and its dependencies in a dedicated *virtual environment*.

[`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is a software that takes care of this. It comes with a "base" environment, from which we will create and manage other, project-specific environments. It is also used to download and install Python in each of those environments, as well as third-party libraries. `conda` in itself is free and open-source and can be used freely by anyone.

It is included with the Anaconda distribution, which is subject to [specific terms of service](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/update-on-anacondas-terms-of-service-for-academia-and-research), which state that unless you're an individual, a member of a company with less than 200 employees or a member of an university (but *not* a national research lab) it's free to use, otherwise, you need to pay a licence. `conda`, while being free, is by default configured to use the "defaults" channel to fetch the packages (including Python itself), a repository operated by Anaconda, which is, itself, subject to the Anaconda terms of service.

In contrast, 'conda-forge' is a community-run repository that contains more numerous and more update-to-date packages. This is free to use for anyone. The idea is to use `conda` directly (instead of Anaconda graphical interface) and download packages from 'conda-forge' (instead of the Anaconda-run 'defaults'). To try to decipher this mess, Anaconda provides this figure :

![Anaconda terms of service](images/anaconda-licences.png)

Furthermore, the "base" conda environment installed with the Anaconda distribution is bloated and already contains tons of libraries, and tends to self-destruct at some point (eg. becomes unable to resolve the inter-dependencies), which makes you unable to install new libraries nor create new environments.

This is why it is *highly* recommended to install Miniconda instead, a minimal installer for conda, and configure it to use the free, community-run channel conda-forge, or, even better, use Miniforge which is basically the same but pre-configured to use conda-forge. The only downside is that you will not get the Anaconda graphical user interface and you'll need to use the terminal instead, but worry not ! We got you covered.

!!! example ""
    1. Download and install [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) (choose the latest release for your system). During the installation, choose to install for the current user, add conda to PATH and make Python the default interpreter.
    2. Open a terminal (PowerShell in Windows). Run :
    ```bash
    conda init
    ```
    This will activate conda and its base environment whenever you open a new PowerShell window. Now, when opening a new PowerShell (or terminal), you should see a prompt like this :
    ```bash
    (base) PS C:\Users\myname>
    ```

!!! tip
    If Anaconda is already installed and you don't have the rights to uninstall it, you'll have to use it instead. You can launch the "Anaconda Prompt (PowerShell)", run `conda init`. Open a regular PowerShell window and run `conda config --add channels conda-forge`, so that subsequent installations and environments creation will fetch required dependencies from conda-forge.

## Install `cuisto`
This section explains how to actually install the `cuisto` package.
The following commands should be run from a terminal (PowerShell). Remember that the `-c conda-forge` bits are not necessary if you installed conda with the miniforge distribution.

!!! example ""
    1. Create a virtual environment named "cuisto-env" with python 3.12 :
    ```
    conda create -c conda-forge -n cuisto-env python=3.12
    ```
    2. We need to install it *inside* the `cuisto-env` environment we just created. First, you need to *activate* the `cuisto-env` environment :
    ```bash
    conda activate cuisto-env
    ```
    Now, the prompt should look like this :
    ```bash
    (cuisto-env) PS C:\Users\myname>
    ```
    This means that Python packages will now be installed in the `cuisto-env` environment and won't conflict with other toolboxes you might be using.
    3. Then, we use `pip` to install `cuisto`. `pip` was installed with Python, and will fetch the latest release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
    ```bash
    pip install cuisto
    ```
    4. Get a copy of the `cuisto` Source code .zip package, from the [Releases](https://github.com/TeamNCMC/cuisto/releases/latest) page, to have access to all the utility scripts in the `scripts/` folder.

`cuisto` is now installed inside the `cuisto-env` environment and will be available in Python from that environment !

!!! tip
    You can run `pip install cuisto --upgrade` from the `cuisto-env` environment to update the package.

If you already have registered images and cells in QuPath, you can export Annotations and Detections as TSV files and head to the [Example](main-using-notebooks.md) section. Otherwise, check out the Guides section on the left panel.
