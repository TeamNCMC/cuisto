# Introduction
`cuisto` is a Python package aiming at quantifying histological data.

After [ABBA](https://abba-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) registration of 2D histological slices and [QuPath](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) objects' detection, `cuisto` is used to :

+ compute metrics, such as objects density in each brain regions,
+ compute objects distributions in three three axes (rostro-caudal, dorso-ventral and medio-lateral),
+ compute averages and sem across animals,
+ display all the above.

This documentation contains `cuisto` [installation instructions](guide-installation.md#install-cuisto), ABBA [installation instructions](guide-install-abba.md), guides to [prepare images](guide-create-pyramids.md) for the pipeline, [detect objects](guide-qupath-objects.md) with QuPath, [register 2D slices on a 3D atlas](guide-register-abba.md) with ABBA, and [`cuisto` usage](guide-use-cuisto.md#using-cuisto) along with [examples](main-using-notebooks.md).

In theory, `cuisto` should work with any measurements table with the [required columns](guide-prepare-qupath.md#qupath-requirements), but has been designed with ABBA and QuPath in mind.

Due to the IT environment of the laboratory, this documentation is very Windows-oriented but most of it should be applicable to Linux and MacOS as well by slightly adapting terminal commands.

## Credits
`cuisto` has been primarly developed by [Guillaume Le Goc](https://legoc.fr) in [Julien Bouvier's lab](https://www.bouvier-lab.com/) at [NeuroPSI](https://neuropsi.cnrs.fr/). The clever name was found by Aur√©lie Bodeau.

The documentation itself is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
